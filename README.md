# Dungeon Adventure Game

This is a practice project where you'll build a text-based dungeon adventure game in Python. The goal is to apply your understanding of variables, operators, lists, dictionaries, loops, and conditionals.

## Project Overview

You will build a game where:
- The player moves through 5 rooms in a dungeon.
- The player can choose to search for treasure, move forward, check their health and inventory, or quit.
- Searching for treasure has a risk: the player may find a treasure or trigger a trap that reduces their health.
- The game ends when the player finishes all rooms, quits, or loses all their health.
- At the end, the game displays the playerâ€™s final health, inventory of treasures, and the total treasure value.

## Concepts Practiced
- Variables and operators
- Lists and dictionaries
- Loops and conditional logic
- The `random` module


## Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the notebook file (`dungeon_adventure.ipynb`) in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. Follow the prompts to build your game step by step.
4. When finished, push your completed work back to your GitHub repository.

## Strtch Goals (optional)
- Create a dictionary of traps with varying damage levels.
- Implement a scoring system that combines health and treasure value.
- Allow players to play multiple rounds and track high scores across games.

## Submission
Submit the link to your completed GitHub repository in OpenClass when finished.
